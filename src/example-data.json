I'd get back from running errands and the place would be a shitshow. The horses would be destroying the hay barn and the cows were in the neighbor's hay fields or tearing up the lawn. And the donkey is off on his own like he had nothing to do with it.</p>\n<p>Edit: Yes. This donkey inspired my username.</p>",
